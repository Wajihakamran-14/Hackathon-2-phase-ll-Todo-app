# Hero Section Design

## Instructions

1. **Layout structure**
   - Full viewport height
   - Centered content
   - Eye-catching headline

2. **Visual elements**
   - Gradient background
   - Animated elements
   - CTA button

3. **Animations**
   - Fade in on load
   - Parallax effects
   - Smooth scrolling

## Best Practices
- Keep headline under 10 words
- Use high-contrast text
- Single clear call-to-action
- Mobile-first approach

## Example Structure
```html
<section class="hero">
  <div class="hero-content">
    <h1 class="animate-fade-in">Your Headline</h1>
    <p class="animate-fade-in-delay">Supporting text</p>
    <button class="cta-button">Get Started</button>
  </div>
</section> """
